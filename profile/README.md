<h1>We are infmapr developer team the creators of infmapi also known as infmapr. If you have not heard of the game site, here's all you need to know.</h1>

<h2>The website has an instant click about:blank cloaking so its hard for people in the office/school to track if you on that website</h2>
<h2>We are still working on a much better theme but for how it is right now you can navigate through the website pretty darn easily</h2>
<h2>We also have proxy service on the website</h2>
<h2>This site has one unique game selection added to it called retro games. In retro games, you have 50+ old Gameboy games that can be played on a laptop or pc </h2>
